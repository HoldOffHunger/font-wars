Font Wars is a typing game-slash-trainer. You play the brave Sgrt. A,
trapped behind enemy lines and forced to fend off waves of enemy words
with nothing but your trusty exclaimation point.

Gameplay is straightforward. Words come towards you and you must type 
them before they reach you. There are no special controls: just type.

There are no graphics.  Text or ascii art is used for everything.  jQuery 
is used for animation, and no HTML5 canvas is used or needed.  It does use 
HTML5 audio, however, for background music and sound effects.

Some sound effects came from freesound.org and require attribution:
